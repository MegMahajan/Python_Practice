#Given a list in Python and provided the positions of the elements, 
#write a program to swap the two elements in the list. 

#List = [23, 65, 19, 90],pos1 = 1, pos2 = 3
# Output : [19, 65, 23, 90]

List = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
pos1 = 2
pos2 = 5
# Output : [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]

# for i in List:
#     print(i)

# print("Input : ", List)
# a = List[0]
# #print(a)
# c = List[2]
# #print(c)

# List[0] = c
# List[2] = a

# print("Output : ",List)
